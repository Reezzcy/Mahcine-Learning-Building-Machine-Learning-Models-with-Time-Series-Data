# Project Building Machine Learning Models with Time Series Data

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a stock price prediction model using TensorFlow, focusing on Bank Central Asia (BCA) stock. Using time series data, the model will be trained to predict BCA's future stock price based on historical data. TensorFlow, as an open-source machine learning library, enables the development of efficient and effective deep learning models for time series data analysis.

## Objective
- Transform stock price data into a format suitable for time series analysis, including data normalisation or standardisation.
- Develop a deep learning model using an architecture suitable for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series data.
- Train the model using the preprocessed historical data, dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Tools
- Google Colaboratory
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
- SciKit-Learn
- Pandas
- Ziplife
